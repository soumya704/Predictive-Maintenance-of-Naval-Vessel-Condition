# Predictive-Maintenance-of-Naval-Vessel-Condition

The Predictive Maintenance project for naval vessels focuses on utilizing data-driven approaches to predict the maintenance needs of critical components on naval vessels. By analyzing historical maintenance records, sensor data, and operational parameters, the project aims to develop models that can forecast the remaining useful life (RUL) of key components such as engines, pumps, and electrical systems. The goal is to implement proactive maintenance strategies that can reduce downtime, improve operational efficiency, and enhance overall fleet readiness.

The project will involve data collection from various sensors and maintenance logs onboard naval vessels. Data preprocessing techniques will be applied to clean and normalize the data for analysis. Feature engineering will be used to extract relevant features that can help predict the RUL of components. Machine learning algorithms, such as regression and survival analysis models, will be employed to build predictive models.

The models will be trained and validated using historical data, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall will be used to evaluate their effectiveness. The project will also focus on real-time monitoring and alerting mechanisms to notify maintenance crews when components are likely to fail, allowing for timely intervention and maintenance.
